		<h2>COMPUTER </h2>
		<h5><u style=" color: blue;"> GO TO TOP </u></h5> 
		<P>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations. 
		Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem. </p>
		<h5>cpu</h5> 
		<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also referred to as a central processor unit,is the hardware within a computer that
		 carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output 
		 operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.The form, design,
		 and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same </p>
		<h5>ALU</h5> 
		<p>In computing, an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations.
		 The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain 
		 one for purposes such as maintaining  timers. The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs) accommodate
		 very powerful and very complex ALUs; a single component may contain a number of ALUs.</p>
